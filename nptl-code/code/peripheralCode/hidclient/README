make sure the two lines have been added to /etc/bluetooth/main.conf (see the rigManagement/configuration dir)

ensure bluetooth is working via hciconfig

startBluetoothBrainMouse

can use stopBluetoohBrainMouse if things misbehave to kill everything (hopefully)

OLD instructions
make the adapter changes by calling setupBluetoothParams
ensure the /tmp/hidMouse fifo exists by calling mkBluetoothFIFO
run the hidclient bridge via runHIDBridge
